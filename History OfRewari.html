                The History of the district Rewari is contemporary to the history of Delhi.
                During Mahabharta period there was a king named Rewat He had a daughter
                whose name was Rewati.But the king used to call her Rewa lovingly. The king
                founded and established a city named “Rewa wadi” after the name of her daughter.
                Later on, Rewa got married with Balram, elder brother of Lord Krishna and the
                king donated the city “Rewa wadi “as dowry to her daughter.Later the city Rewa
                wadi became Rewari.

                The chapter of brass in the history of Rewari was linked to the last Hindu king of Delhi,
                Hema Chandra Vikram Aditya alias Hemu. Hemu started the work of making brass cannons in Rewari.
                At that time brass cannons were considered a guarantee of winning the war. The border of Rewari is
                adjacent to Rajasthan. Naturally, with the sun's heat and dust storms, there is a severe shortage of
                water ... To meet this lack of water, all kinds of watering pots filled with pieces of brass left
                over
                by cannons. Began to be made .... On seeing this, the brass utensils made in Rewari started going
                far
                and wide.

                Rewari came under the control of Maratha Empire in 19th century before passing on to East India
                Company and later British Raj. Rao Tula Ram, the ruler of Rewari, played a significant role in
                India's First War of Independence in 1857. His estate was confiscated by the British Raj and made a
                part of Gurgaon district of Punjab province. It remained a part of Gurgaon district until
                reorganisation in 1972 saw it transferred to Mahendragarh district. Further changes in 1989 led to
                the creation of the eponymous Rewari district

            <p class="History_paragraph-section">
                Rewari is well known for the high proportion of soldiers and officers it contributes to the
                Indian army and other armed forces of India. Rezang La near Chushul in Ladakh was the site of
                the last stand of C Company of the 13 Kumaon battalion, during the Sino-Indian War on 18 November
                1962.The C Company was composed almost entirely of Ahirs and was led by Major Shaitan Singh, who
                won a posthumous Param Vir Chakra for his actions. In this action 120 men of the C Company fought
                until their bullets finished and then fought hand-to-hand.
                Of the 120 men, 114 died and only six seriously injured men remained alive. Of these, five were
                captured POW
                and only one came down to inform others. A memorial was constructed in Rewari city for them
